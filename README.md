## Bank-Teller Applicaiton

Object-oriented concepts with the core C++ language and the standard library.

### Specification:

The user is the bank teller who adds customers to the system and processes customer transactions.The teller    
processes deposits, withdrawals, and retrieves balances until the customer is finished. The teller   
also ends the month to apply interest to savings and reset the transaction counters for each account.       

Savings accounts have an interest rate, and interest is applied at the end of the month. Checking   
accounts are limited to 4 transactions within a month. A fee of $1.50 is applied for every transaction   
thereafter. When the teller ends the month, interest is applied to savings accounts and the transaction     
counters are zeroed.
